### Paper ID 79
- Disease Inference with Symptom Extraction and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network

### Draft Submission
- Our implementation of the TF-IDF + Bi-LSTM model
- trained and evaluated with the IMDb data set as we haven't been able to obtained the original data set
  - We have contacted the original authors of the paper to request the original data set, but haven't received any responses yet
- Please refer to our [draft report](https://github.com/yixingz3/DL4H_team_project/blob/main/CS598DL4H_project_template_2022Spring_team64.pdf) for more detials 

### Final Submission
